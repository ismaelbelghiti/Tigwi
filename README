ConnectionInformation :
To connect to Azure, you will need a file named ConnectionInfo.xml placed at the root of the project (same directory as the README file) which looks like Example.ConnectionInfo.xml (To complete with your connection informations)

There is a list, named ConnectionFiles of files in which the strings __AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME and __AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY will be replaced by the values read in ConnectionInfo.xml
You can customize this list.
Warning : The position of the files in the list must be given relatively to the position of the file Tigwi.ccproj
